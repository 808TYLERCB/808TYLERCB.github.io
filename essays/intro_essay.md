My name is Tyler Brede. I'm 24 years old and originally from the Big Island of Hawaii. Recently, I relocated to Oahu to continue my education at the University of Hawaii.

Initially, I pursued a degree in computer science. After a few courses, it became evident that while the subject was comprehensive, it wasn't the right fit for me. My interest wasn't strictly in programming or the intricacies of software but in a broader application of technology in the business world.

Upon further research, I came across the Management Information Systems (MIS) program at Shidler. The MIS curriculum appeared to be a more appropriate match for my interests and background. This program emphasizes the application of technology in business settings and appeared to be a better avenue for me, given my initial grounding in computer science.

Oahu, compared to the Big Island, offers a different environment. The pace is faster, and the academic setting is more intensive. While here, I intend to focus on my studies in MIS and prepare for a future career that merges both technology and business.

In summary, while I began my academic journey in computer science, I believe transitioning to MIS is a logical and beneficial move for my career aspirations. As I progress in this program at UH, I anticipate gaining a solid foundation that will serve me well in the professional world.
