  <p>The Browser History WODs presented an intricate journey through web development, offering significant insights into HTML, CSS, and various tools. Here’s a breakdown of my experience,the first assignment’s emphasis was predominantly on HTML. The initial step involved a thorough review of the task guidelines to ensure a clear understanding of the objectives. Professor Ports’ instructional video served as a beneficial resource. The video highlighted effective methods, strategic thought processes, and a structured approach to coding, which proved essential for the task at hand. Upon delving into the assignment, I allocated ample time for a comprehensive approach. The initial build took approximately an hour, during which cross-referencing with other resources was frequent. This exercise wasn’t just about code implementation but also about understanding the foundational aspects of HTML. By the end of the assignment, the code was developed from scratch in a span of 18 minutes.</p>

<p>The second WOD introduced a layer of complexity with the incorporation of CSS, focusing on aesthetics and the proper placement of existing HTML elements. As with the first assignment, the methodology remained consistent: initiate with the screencast video for guidance, review supplemental materials, and then delve into hands-on coding. The addition of the CSS file presented a unique set of challenges. However, perseverance and critical problem-solving skills played pivotal roles in navigating through these intricacies. This WOD enhanced my confidence in addressing and resolving challenges in the realm of web development. The third assignment furthered the usage of CSS. Despite being slightly more challenging than its predecessors, it provided a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between HTML and CSS. This WOD demanded more meticulous attention to detail, especially in ensuring that CSS was seamlessly integrated with the existing HTML structures.</p>
