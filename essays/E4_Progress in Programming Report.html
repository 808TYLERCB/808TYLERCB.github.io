  <p>Improvements in Programming Skills:</p>

<p>Initially, as a former CS major, I had basic knowledge of programming, limited to Java, with no exposure to HTML or JavaScript. This course, under Professor Sal’s guidance, and aided by online tools like GPT, has markedly accelerated my understanding and problem-solving abilities in coding. My grasp of programming concepts and methodologies has deepened, and the course’s varied topics and exercises have honed my programming skills significantly.</p>

<p>Areas for Further Improvement:</p>

<p>I’ve noticed an overreliance on resources like GPT, which, while helpful, sometimes hindered deep learning of key concepts. Going forward, I aim to tackle coding problems more independently, enhancing my instant problem-solving skills. Additionally, a deeper dive into the core principles of coding and programming, through written materials and extra lectures, will be beneficial for a more robust understanding.</p>

<p>Learning from WODs (Workouts of the Day):</p>

<p>The POKEs and WODs have been greatly instructive. While following walkthroughs has made learning easier due to my visual learning style, I acknowledge the importance of independently absorbing the material for more effective retention.</p>

<p>Lab Experience:</p>

<p>The labs have been instrumental in my learning journey. Each one, while challenging, was manageable and highly relevant, particularly for Assignment 1. Initially, the length and complexity of labs were daunting, but utilizing resources like video walkthroughs and AI tools helped me find a rhythm and effectively complete them.</p>

<p>Growth from Assignment 1 and Preparation for Assignment 2:</p>

<p>Assignment 1 was an intensive and rewarding project, presenting numerous challenges that I am proud to have overcome. The experience has set a solid foundation for the subsequent assignments, and I’m eager to apply the learned skills and insights to tackle Assignment 2.</p>

<p>Suggestions for Course Improvement:</p>

<p>The course might benefit from a more focused curriculum, emphasizing key fundamentals and real-world applications of programming. The current broad range of topics, while comprehensive, can be overwhelming and might lead to a lack of depth in certain areas.</p>

<p>Most Helpful Aspects of the Class:</p>

<p>Professor Sal’s engaging lectures and videos have made learning programming more accessible. Additionally, the opportunity to collaborate with classmates has been invaluable, making larger assignments and projects feel more manageable.</p>
