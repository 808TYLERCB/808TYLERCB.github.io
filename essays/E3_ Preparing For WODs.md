The <p> <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html">WOD 5.1</a> assignment aimed to enhance the maintainability of a Smart Phone products display webpage by replacing hard-coded information with JavaScript variables. This modular approach required defining variables for product names, prices, and image URLs and then using JavaScript's document.write() to dynamically populate these details into HTML elements. Initially, I found the process of identifying and replacing the relevant HTML tags like <h2>, <p>, and <img> to be somewhat challenging, but the use of regular expressions aided in this task. The modularization was further advanced by separating all variable declarations into an external JavaScript file, which not only made the code cleaner but also easier to manage. This was a departure from previous WODs, as it necessitated a solid understanding of JavaScript in addition to HTML and CSS.

To prepare for the WOD, I started by comprehensively reading the problem statement, as I usually do. However, unlike previous WODs that were more CSS and HTML-centric, this assignment required a more in-depth understanding of JavaScript. Therefore, I revisited basic JavaScript concepts, especially focusing on methods like document.write(). For future WODs, I would consider automating the process of updating variables across multiple sections to minimize human errors. Brushing up on regular expressions would also be beneficial as they can be powerful tools for pattern matching in strings, which would have expedited the replacement of HTML elements in this WOD. Overall, this exercise was valuable in understanding the importance of code modularity and how JavaScript can be leveraged to make HTML content more dynamic and easier to maintain.
